                    In 2012, I remember jumping around in my room,
                    screaming to the lyrics of ‘We Are Never Ever Getting
                    Back Together’ and thinking, there is no way I would
                    get this ecstatic feeling of listening to feel good songs
                    and if I had to, I would pay to get it back. In 2012, I
                    remember how much adoration I have for the
                    magnificent woman who came up with the utmost
                    heart wrenching lyrics a ten year old me has ever
                    heard. In 2012, living with busy parents, no one had
                    ever taught me about letting a feeling out, until I
                    stumbled upon Taylor Swift’s album ‘Red’. Like the
                    color, it symbolizes bravery, love, and heartbreak. At
                    that time, it meant the entire world for me and I can
                    proudly announce that it was one of the most
                    impactful survival kits to grow up with.

                    In 2021, never in my wildest dreams I would have
                    gotten to re-experience the mentioned ecstatic feeling back, and even better (for free too! if the
                    Spotify subscription doesn’t count). In 2021, the adoration remains the same, it tripled actually,
                    and yet, as a nineteen year old youth growing, my heart still gets wrenched, especially with the
                    extended version of ‘All Too Well’. In 2021, I have learned so many things about the world. My
                    parents remain busy though, but I got to cross paths with the one that introduced me to the
                    constant feeling, Taylor Swift’s album ‘Red (Taylor’s Version)’. At this time, it still means the
                    world to me, moreover it instantly became the footnotes in the story of my life.

                    With 10 extended tracks, the album Red (Taylor’s Version) wrapped up a total 2 hours
                    and 10 minutes long, a roller-coaster of mixed emotions. Including one of the most anticipated
                    tracks of the year, the 10 minutes version of an ageless break up anthem, All Too Well.
                    Nonetheless, the older tracks still proceed to age like a fine wine. But we are also fortunate
                    enough to get to listen to the version Taylor Swift wanted us to hear, such as the new pop beat
                    from the track ‘Girl At Home’.Taylor Swift’s matured voice makes the classics such as ‘22’ and ‘I
                    Knew You Were Trouble’ feel better and proves how it deserves the title classic.

                    While talking about Taylor Swift, it is mandatory to bring up the topic of her heartfelt style
                    of lyric making. It can be seen from one of the From The Vault tracks, such as ‘Nothing New’, a
                    ballad featuring a young singer Phoebe Bridgers, talks about expectations for women in the
                    music industry, where society forced them to be “young” and called out the unfair and sexist
                    critics. It is also expressing the feeling of burn-out coming from the line, “How can a person
                    know everything at 18 but nothing at 22?”. It has become one of the public’s favorites knowing
                    how relatable the lyrics were. But the number one position for the mentioned title is still being
                    held by All Too Well (10 Minutes Version).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Taylor Swift is well known for her way of expressing feelings through her lyrics and the
                    new verses of All Too Well proved the fact right. She proved that it is possible to make a song
                    even sadder than it already is. She made us feel the emotion she felt while writing the lyrics,
                    heck she even made me want to feel a heartbreak from a relationship. Even the way she sings
                    it, the flow, and the way the song goes, it does not even feel like a ten minute song. She made
                    us feel and remember the song, literally, all too well.
                    Quoted from Taylor Swift, who quoted from Willi
                </p>
                <p>
                    Quoted from Taylor Swift, who quoted from William Shakespeare, ‘All’s well that ends
                    well”. The journey of getting into a particular place had numerous bumps, it must have
                    numerous bumps in the road, in order for it to end in a beautiful way. The making of Red
                    (Taylor’s Version) might have been a bumpy road, feelings were being hurt and tears were
                    strolled down, but it was all worth it because the result was an embodiment of a masterpiece. It
                    was all worth it, it was all red. (sff)
