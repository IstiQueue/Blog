                    A Long story about long stories from recipe blogs and why they exist--along with my brownie recipe.

                    No one goes to a food blog to read. 
                    Everyone skips over the lengthy paragraphs about the author's family tradition and tries to get to the recipe--the thing they came for-- as fast as possible. 
                    Sentimental paragraphs about how the recipe came to be have been mocked by the internet countless times. 
                    So, if there is such collective hate against these stories, why are they so common? Why do recipe bloggers still include them in every post?

                            <p>
                                When you google something, Google uses search engine optimization to give you the best results. There are certain things Google searches for when trying to find a recipe for you. The recipe has to have certain keywords and features, one of which is a show of expertise. Google wants to show recipes of experienced chefs and bakers to give their users the best experience possible. Food bloggers can showcase their expertise through a story of how they developed their recipe, how they discovered it, or going in-depth about the specifics of their recipe (e.g. talking about why rice flour is better than all-purpose). Google also likes longer articles as opposed to short ones. This is why many food bloggers have long stories in their recipes; to appeal to Google's search engine optimization, which will, in turn, produce more clicks for their website.

                            This one is a no-brainer and goes along with reason number 1. Lengthy blogs mean spending more time on the website. The more time you spend on the website, the more advertisements you see. And, the more advertisements you see, the more money the author makes.

                        <p>
                            The internet is a great place for showcasing your product, but the amount of competition is staggering. There are over 200 million blogs on the internet. So, standing out is crucial. Food bloggers can differentiate themselves from their competition by attaching a story to their recipes. There are millions of cookie recipes out there and it is easy to be forgotten, but if you make a recipe personal by mentioning how it has been passed down from generations, you can grab a reader's attention. Revealing stories and anecdotes can make your blog seem less like a set of instructions and more like a food diary.

                            Personally, I like my food to be personal. I like the feeling of a food or recipe being mine. So when an author shares their experience with me, I feel as if it has been passed down, I feel as though I have been in their shoes, and that makes for a special connection with the recipe. I also like recipes more when I like the creators. I remember religiously following every recipe of a Youtube baker simply because she had a cute voice. She brought so much character into her videos and spoke with so much passion when talking about food. As I was following along, I couldn’t help but feel as excited as she was.

                        I have gone through endless variations of brownie recipes to finally come across this masterpiece. Note that no ingredient can be replaced (e.g. white sugar with brown sugar) because I have tried replacing each ingredient with exceptional alternatives (e.g. butter with margarine or yogurt–don’t ask) but was disappointed every time.

                                160g butter (room temperature!) <br>

                                Stir in a bowl. Note: the white sugar is for crispy-ness! White sugar is what will make the cracked top of the brownie that I love so much. The butter also has to be at room temperature because of the texture it will provide to the brownie. Microwaved butter (liquid butter) won’t do because it will

                                Add all of these into the same bowl. The order does not really matter, but I think it turns out better when you pour the eggs in first.

                                Add these ingredients into a separate bowl and mix them together. If you’d like, you can sift these ingredients. There is a significant change when you do sift them, but they will taste good either way.

                                Last but not least, melt the chocolate in a separate bowl. I prefer 75% chocolate because brownies are about cocoa, not sugar and milk. 75% chocolate will give your brownies a rich taste. You may use 70% chocolate too, but know that I am judging you for it.

                                You can now the first two bowls together (everything except the chocolate). Make sure to stir gently, not whisk. After mixing for about 5 minutes, go ahead and add the melted chocolate. Put it into a 375-degree oven for 40 minutes, and you are done!
