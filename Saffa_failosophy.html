                    Failures are usually identified with negativities, but what if I tell
                    you that it could be the opposite? This is my review of the book "Failosophy".

                    What’s one thing people want to feel the least but realistically
                    everybody gets to feel it in any type of form? Failure. There is no
                    way you can avoid failure, one has to feel it at least once in their
                    life. Failures are usually identified with negativities, but what if I tell
                    you that it could be the opposite? What if there is an alternate way
                    of seeing it? What if I told you there is a next chapter after the
                    chapter of failure? Let me introduce you to failosophy, a book
                    written by Elizabeth Day, the bestselling author of ‘How To Fail’.

                </p>
                <p>
                    So what is failosophy exactly? It is a big pile compilation of
                    different principles, perspectives, and advice Elizabeth Day has
                    found as a podcaster, or a journalist in general. In which she hoped
                    to be inspirational for the reader and hopefully guide them to be
                    more open with their failures. But of course, it also contains stories
                    about the author as well. What makes it ironic is that, usually when
                    an influential person writes a book, they will write about how they
                    got into the position they are in right now, Elizabeth Day wrote
                    about the lowest point in their life.

                <p>
                    As humans, we often stumble upon unexpected obstacles, and failure is one of them.
                    It is common and completely humane for us to be affected by it, but what makes us
                    extraordinary is if we turn them around, and see it in a different light. A light to see that it can
                    be a factor for you to develop and improve for the future. This book encourages you to do
                    so, as I quote directly from the book, “Once you admit your own vulnerabilities and choose to
                    share them, they are no longer fearful things to avoid: the adult equivalent of the bogeyman
                    under the bed.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    Vulnerabilities are usually overlooked as weak, when in reality it functions as a bridge
                    between a great weakness and strength of ourselves. Seeking the courage to walk and own
                    the bridge is hard, but once you admit and embrace it, each step you take in the bridge will
                    feel as light as a feather. The talk of this topic is one out of seven principles Elizabeth Day
                    come up with the full list;
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Failure is just is</li>
                    <li>You are not your worst thoughts</li>
                    <li>Almost everyone feels they've failed at their twenties</li>
                    <li>Break ups are not a tragedy</li>
                    <li>Failure is data acquisition</li>
                    <li>There is no such thing as a future you</li>
                    <li>Being open about our vulnerabilities is the source of true strength</li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    The more I turned the page, the more I realized how relatable the entire book is to
                    my life. The way each principle could be applied to each problem of my life proved how I am
                    more than certain to recommend the book to the fellow youngsters out there. All in hope to
                    be not attached with the haunted feeling of failure, befriend it, or even dethrone it. (sff)
