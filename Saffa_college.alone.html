                    Enrolling in a college is always a big head step for a student. A lot of things will change
                    once you step foot in your desired campus. It is the first step of adulthood, therefore you have to
                    be careful and responsible when it comes to being a college student. One of the biggest
                    responsibilities you could think of is to live independently as a college student. The choices of
                    your desired university are limitless, it could be in your hometown or even abroad. Though it
                    depends on your financial stability, it is still definitely something that should be considered. And
                    for that you should understand that being responsible only for yourself can go both ways.
                    Especially during your college years, the first time you flap your wings from youth into
                    adulthood. You should decide and think carefully for which path you will take in college.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Living alone for college means you are only responsible for yourself. There are no rules
                    being made for you, except by yourself. No curfews, having your own food leftovers, no
                    limitation of dress codes, and only having to clean up after yourself. One of the best reasons to
                    live alone is you can come home to a peaceful environment, without loud arguments from your
                    parents or your siblings. Studies even proved that it affects your learning process. Moreover,
                    with you living alone, it exceeds the possibility of any drama or conflicts in your life, and it makes
                    your home more peaceful. Living alone in college also will open up to unexpected opportunities,
                    habits, and practically new things that were limited because of parental guidance. Living alone
                    in college means there’s a freedom from any judgment, it is the easiest way possible for you to
                    figure out your true self. Ergo, it is easier for you to live your life to the fullest if you live alone.
                </p>

                    However, every big decision will always come off with a negative outcome. And that
                    does not exclude the choice to live alone. There are a few cons we can break down. First, a
                    simple dorm or a one bedroom apartment can be really expensive for a college student, this is
                    why your financial situation should be considered first. Usually, most college students find
                    themselves a roommate to split the rent pay, that means you will not be having the home for
                    yourself. Second, living alone can get really lonely, there will be no one to come home to, talk to
                    about yours or their days, or spend quality time without leaving the house. Third, you have to
                    figure out what you should eat in a day, and it is going to be hard because for the rest of your
                    life, it has always been prepared by people in your home, your mom or your maid. And for that
                    reason we come to the fourth con, you have to manage your money by yourself. If you don’t
                    know how to manage your money, you will find living by yourself a hardship. You have to divide
                    your money into the necessities for you to live, to save up, and to spend.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The majority of college students chose to live alone with so many factors, each of them
                    has their own reasonable causes. One of the biggest reasons from the students, including me,
                    is family problems. Personally, I find my growing up house to be a toxic household, it stops me
                    from growing and learning wholefully. It sets unnecessary boundaries that were not supposed to
                    be there, it felt like I was being held hostage. And for people who relate to what I feel, living
                    alone felt like a paradise to us. Therefore, living alone in college is the best way for us to live, to
                    feel humane. Aside from that, it might get lonely sometimes at some point, but it will help you
                    know yourself. It brings responsibility, structure, and balance into your life. After all, you are the
                    author of your life, you are the biggest person in charge of everything you do. And living alone
                    will enhance and enrich your life choices, it will lead you to what is right for you.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are various factors to consider if you choose to live alone, and after all everything
                    will have to come back to us. It depends on the needs of ourselves. You should consider it from
                    a different perspective, from the viewpoint of financial situation, your mental health situation,
                    social situation, and/or geographic situation. Moreover, especially during the pandemic era, it
                    should be highly considered because the biggest damage is for your health. That way, you will
                    be able to prioritize what’s better for you, without getting any involvement from anyone else. And
                    hopefully it will help you have an enjoyable head step from being a high school student to an
                    independent college student.
